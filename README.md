# Facial Recognition Software
A facial recognition software that uses a photo(s) to detect faces and give an accuracy percentage.


# How To Run
-> Make sure you are on python version `3.11.9`

-> Add images (.png - .jpeg - .jpg) of faces that you want to detect in the `new_faces` folder
  -> *make sure to remove the .gitkeep file*

-> Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

-> Run `python3 main.py`


# Common Issues

-> Remove all files that are not images from the `new_faces` folder. Sometimes hidden files like `.DS_Store` will cause an error.
